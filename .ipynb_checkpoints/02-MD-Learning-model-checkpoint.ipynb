    "## Step 1: Download LAMMPS for Windows Executable\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to download the LAMMPS Windows Executable:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Goto the LAMMPS download webpage, http://packages.lammps.org/windows.html\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/img1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select the correct 32-bit or 64-bit versions for your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/img2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Take 64-bit version for example, there are serial version for serial computation (The sequential execution of all parts of the same task on a single processor) and Multiple Process Message Passing Interface (MPI) version for parrallel computation avialable. The serial version lammps can be runned on windows platform directly. While MPI version cannot be runned without MPI librarys installed on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now select the correct version for your download.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once downloaded, installed the version on your computer. For 64-bit version, the default installation directory will be 'C:\\Program Files\\LAMMPS 64-bit DDMMYY', 'DDMMYY' are the version ended with the date. Also, you can find the path have been added to the windows environment varibale\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Run LAMMPS via commond line\n",
    "1. Create a new folder in you disk, for example, 'D:\\MDSimulation\\', copy the Examples folder in LAMMPS directory into your own folder.\n",

    "![](img/img3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Press âŠž Win + R to open Run. And input 'cmd' to open the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the shell command line, change to the directory '..\\Example\\shear' you created. For example: 'D:\\MDSimulation\\Examples\\shear'\n"
