    "In this tutorial, you will learn to create an MD model in LAMMPS with the LAMMPS modelling commands. Before you create the model, you need to know the basic crystalline structure knowledge - especially [Bravais Lattices structure](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Introduction_to_Inorganic_Chemistry/06%3A_Metals_and_Alloys-_Structure%2C_Bonding%2C_Electronic_and_Magnetic_Properties/6.03%3A_Bravais_Lattices).\n",

    "## Step 1: Understand the basic LAMMPS environment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In LAMMPS, there are several units environment indicated by the LAMMPS units command.\n",
    "\n",
    "reference: https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/units.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The command style is:\n",
    "\n",
    "units style\n",
    "\n",
    "The style could be *metal*, *lj*, *real*, etc. For metallic material, it recommends the *metal* unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, following command will define the boundary of your simulation box.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command style is:\n",
    "\n",
    "boundary x y z\n",
    "\n",
    "reference: https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/boundary.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary command follows x, y, z three parameters which indicates the boundary types in three directions. According to the LAMMPS command reference, four types boudary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "p is periodic\n",
    "f is non-periodic and fixed\n",
    "s is non-periodic and shrink-wrapped\n",
    "m is non-periodic and shrink-wrapped with a minimum value\n",
